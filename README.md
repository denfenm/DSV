# Dream Start-up Ventures Database Systems
This is from my assignment that was based on a real client. We were given a SRS and Business Process Change to create DB System.

Business Process Change: Document 2017 (V3.1.6) 
1. The system need to record staff information, as a requirement for the knowing which staff whom brought the sales. This information is for all the bookings that are made personally with the staff.  
2. The system should detail down the customers address and multiple contact number for emergencies and direct marketing purpose.  
3. If booking are made during the sales period, relevant information on discount rate, sales period need to be recorded. Ensure that this information is recoded into the right entity.  
4. Projections – the company would require the system to be able to generate total loss for the year and total income for the year. You are required to ensure that all the necessary information is recorded in the table, allowing the user to compute this totals without messy procedures.  
5. Final requirement – open suggestion from your team to include 2 more requirements that would be added advantage for the system. Include the requirement into Business Process Change 2018 (V3.1.7).  
 
Task: 
A) Business Process Change 2018 (V3.1.7).  
 
B) Design 1. Entity – Relationship Diagram (ERD) - Map the entities with appropriate relationships  2. Physical Model  Provide the necessary information for Model (Relational Model - ensure data integrity). 3. Prepare the Data Dictionary for the system that you have planned to roll out. 
 
C) Deployment 4. Implementation – create database, tables and populate the data (each table should have 20 rows of valid records).  
 
D) SQL Report: a. Write SQL query to list down the customer bookings made from January – December 2017. You are required to select the most relevant columns to generate this report.

b. Write SQL query to generate report on total number of bookings made within last three years (2015,2016 and 2017).  c. Provide a report that indicates the total number of booking closed by staff in the year 2017.  d. Identify from the system the staff that have closed the highest sales for the year 2017.  e. Provide a list of hotel that is frequently visited in the 2017.  
 
This SQL report (f & g) does not carry any marks but having a system above the users must be able to generate the below mentioned report.  f. Provide a report identifying customer by town the come from.  g. Generate a list of contact numbers of all customers.  
 
E) SQL Report – Students report design  Prepare five (5) different types of reports using SQL query language. This reports should one that indicate the students are able to analyze the data stored in various tables can provide very meaningful information to the user / client. The mark allocation for this section is based on the complexity and ability of students to analyze the data recorded in various table.
